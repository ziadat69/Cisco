## üìÅ Projects

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Simple Networking Project #1**  
A basic networking project that showcases key network components such as routers, switches, and end devices in a simple topology. The goal is to practice fundamental configurations like IP addressing and basic routing protocols.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Small Office Home Office Network - SOHO**  
A typical small office/home office setup that demonstrates how multiple devices are connected to ensure secure internet access, file sharing, and printing services. This project may include wireless components and basic security features.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Hotel System Network**  
This project focuses on designing a network for a hotel, covering various areas (e.g., guest rooms, administration, restaurant). Special attention is given to VLANs, security measures, and guest network configurations.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **University System Network**  
A larger, more complex network designed for a university or educational institution. It includes multiple subnets, VLANs, redundant connections, and services like VoIP or video surveillance. This project emphasizes scalability and efficiency in a dynamic environment.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Company/Business System Network**  
This project showcases a corporate network design suitable for small to medium-sized businesses. It includes separate departments or workgroups (such as HR, Sales, IT), each with its own VLANs and secure connections to ensure data separation and policy enforcement. It also demonstrates the integration of key services like file servers, VoIP, and security appliances
