# Design a network in  Cisco Packet Tracer to connects ACC and DELY departments through the following:

- Each department should contain at least two PCs.
- Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
- Using the given network 192.168.20.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
- All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
- Test communication between devices in both ACC and DELY departments.




# Technologies Implemented

    - Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
    - Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
    - Connecting two Networks using a Router.
    - Subnetting and IP Addressing.
    - Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
    - Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
    - Test and Verifying Network Communication.
